# Universal_Lcc_Test
Beta testing of 2 servo 40 IO PCA9685

## This is not ready for release but its here to help me keep  version control while 3 members colaberate with the development of this LCC Node.

ESP32 2SVO8IO2MCP2PCA Example.

This sketch implements: 
Native channels, using the processors pins:
  * two servos, each with three positions
    Positions cabe set to angles 0-180
    The 0 and 180 end-points of the servos can be configured.
  * N i/o channels, each of which can be an input or an output,
    If an output it may be solid, pulse or flashing, and consumes an on- and 0ff-event. 
    If an input it produces an on- and off-event, which may each be delayed.  The 
     inputs can be with or with pullups, inverted or not, or can be toggle. 
  * N is a variable number of 'native' i/o depending on the processor, see board.h
Two MCP23017 Port Expanders
  * Each with two banks of 8 i/o channels
  * These have the same characteristics as the native i/o.
  * See: e.g. https://www.amazon.ca/MCP23017-MCP23017-Expander-Expansion-3-0V-5-5V/dp/B0FHRRVKSP/
Two PCA9685 Servo Boards
  * Each has two banks of 8 servos
  * Each servo has two endpoint positions, controlled by to consumed events.
  * Each servo has two events, produced as the servo passes the midpoint between the two midpoints.  
  * See: e.g. https://www.adafruit.com/product/815

It demonstrates: 
* CDI
* memstruct of EEPROM reflecting the CDI structure
* setting flags to refect whether eveentids are used as consumers, producers, or both, see: **const EIDTab eidtab[NUM_EVENT] PROGMEM**
* Initialization routine to initialize the EEPROM, see: **userInitAll()**
* Eventid processing to set a servo's position, see: **pceCallback(unsigned int index)**
* Sampling of inputs and producing events.
* MCP23017 via I2C.  Note channel 7 in each port can only be outputs, otherwise the I2C locks up. 
* PCA9685 via I2C.  

This sketch supports: 
 Processors: Nano, R4 Nano, R4 Minima, ESP32, M5NANOC6
 CAN: MCP2515, R4 CAN, ESP32 TWAI

Configuration:
  config.h allows one to:
    * Choose a nodeID
    * Choose to initialize the EEPROM to factory defaults
    * Choose processor
    * Choose CAN or GCSerial
    * CHoose Debugging output
    * set paramters for the sketch -- changes to these may need changes tot he sketch.  

Notes:
  * if RESET_TO_FACTORY_DEFAULTS is 1, then the EEPROM is intialized, 
    it must be changed to 0 and the sketch reloaded to allow JMRI to change items permanently.
  * The ACAN_ESP32Can.h library has been changed by David Harris.
  MCP23017:
    * Avoid Pin 7 as Input: Move any input devices (switches, sensors) on GPA7/GPB7 to other available pins (0–6).
    * Use Hardware Reset: Connect the Reset pin (Pin 18) to the microcontroller and actively pull it high, or use 
       a 10k resistor to pull it up to VCC to prevent floating.
    * Add Decoupling Capacitors: Place a 0.1µF ceramic capacitor between VCC and GND as close to the chip as 
       possible to filter power noise, which can cause erratic behavior.
    * Use Pull-up Resistors on I2C: Ensure the SDA and SCL lines have pull-up resistors (typically 4.7kΩ).
